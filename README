Instructions:
 
Simply type "make" to compile. To run, enter "p2" followed by the name of the input file containing the polyhedron data you would like
to specify. The values making up the vertices in this file may be positive or negative. If any value exceeds an absolute value of 500.0,
the violating polyhedron portion will be clipped in its rendering. These polyhedrons will be rendered as wireframes and projected 
orthographically into three views: XY/top/elevation, XZ/front/plan, and YZ/side/section. 

Once the polyhedrons have been rendered, you may right click anywhere on the primary viewing window (but outside any of the three projection
subwindows)and a menu will appear. In this menu you may select to translate, scale, or rotate any of the poyhedrons pictured. 

To translate: 
When prompted, type the desired x, y, and z values of translation (in that order) and hit enter.

To scale: 
When prompted, type the magnitude of the scaling and hit enter. 

To rotate: 
When prompted, type the angle of rotation in radians. A positive angle will rotate the selected polygon counter-clockwise.
